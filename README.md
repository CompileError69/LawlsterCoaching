### Design Process :rocket:
------------------

This website is for people that are interested in improving in **Valorant**. The objective of this website is to provide people with better understanding about the **Game**, **Why do you need to be coached** and **How coaching will help them improve on their game**. This would attract users to purchase the coaching service and how reliable the coach is.

The website allows people to book a coaching appointment with their desired coach, they would then connect with the coach, the player would then livestream for the coach to watch and the coach would provide live feedback to the player and help them to improve.

We would like to create a website that is simple to navigate so that users will not have a hard time trying to navigate around the website, aesthetics are also important as it provides a good first impression on potential customers and making them stay.


**What kind of interactions i would like to have on my website**

* A nav bar at the top to navigate through a single scroll page and select what they would want to view
    * Home 
    * About us
    * Reviews
    * Coach Details
    * Contact Us

* I would put up useful information about the coach to make the users trust that the coaches we provide are reliable
* I would put information on why they should hire a coach to guide them and improve significantly in their gameplay.
* Putting up reviews from past customers to provide credibility
